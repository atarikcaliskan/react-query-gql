# React Query with Next.js Typescript & GQL Codegen

This project is a starter kit for a web application built using React Query, Next.js, Typescript, GraphQL Code Generator, and SSR (Server-Side Rendering). It also includes the capability to store cookies on the client and server.

React Query is a library that simplifies fetching, caching, and updating data in your React applications. Next.js is a popular framework for building server-rendered React applications. Typescript provides strong typing and error checking for your code, while GraphQL Code Generator generates type-safe and auto-completed GraphQL queries.

## Features

- React Query for easy fetching, caching, and updating of data
- Next.js for server-side rendering and client-side routing
- Typescript for strong typing and error checking
- GraphQL Code Generator for generating type-safe and auto-completed GraphQL queries
- Dehydrated state for server-side rendering of data
- Cookies for client and server storage
